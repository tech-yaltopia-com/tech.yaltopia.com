    content   : >
      It is our goal in this day and age to help introduce more people to technology. The constant change in the tech world influences and changes everyone’s life with or without them realizing it. But this change can be both for good or for bad. Our goal is for the change to bring a positive impact to your lives. <br> <br> To satisfy this goal, a well-informed and connected community is needed. We as a platform will strive to create said community and bridge the gap forming between people and technology by creating a safe space for people to communicate, consume content and keep getting informed.

     We want to be a platform that solves problems. We want to introduce you to technology that can change your life. This is one of the core ideas of our organization- “To make problems a possibility for improvement.”  That also means we want to enable innovators as well as introduce you to our products which we will be making in the foreseeable future. <br> <br> We want our reach to be global but we humble ourselves because we want to change the continent first, which is Africa. In accordance with various plans being executed across Africa, we believe the next big thing will come from our soil. We will make sure we are one of the driving factors that will shape this dream into reality!
