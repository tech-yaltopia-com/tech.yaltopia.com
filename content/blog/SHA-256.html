<p style="text-align: justify;">Where did I hear that? You may ask yourself these
    questions when you look upon the
    title. Well
    cryptocurrency has been over the headlines on the news and other media for the past two years or more depending
    where
    you are from. Well SHA is just an algorithm that is the bedrock of the block chain and by extension cryptocurrency.
    SHA
    is what is called a deterministic one way hashing algorithm. Upon dissection that definition yields a clear picture
    of
    what SHA is; deterministic means that the algorithm will yield a specific output for a given input, it is also
    referred
    to as one way since there is no algorithmic way to do the function backwards at least not yet and it is a
    mathematical
    function that takes any size input but has an output of a fixed size hence the hash in the nomenclature. The only
    way
    that seems to work is brute force and that is not an algorithmic approach. So now that we know what SHA is, what
    does it
    do? SHA 256 is an algorithm that produces a 256 bit long identifier for any length of digital media. So let us say
    you
    have a petabyte of video files in an archive and wanted to assign a digital finger print to that archive, running
    the
    file through the SHA 256 algorithm will produce a unique, non-reproducible identifier for that file that is only 256
    bits long usually expressed in 64 hex digits; the only way to reproduce that identifier (finger print) would be to
    have
    an exact copy of that archive. The algorithm is also ingenious in the sense that it is developed with the butterfly
    effect in mind, ie. a slight change in a digital file which has a SHA 256 identifier will yield a drastically
    different
    SHA 256 identifier. I am talking about the slightest of changes like changing the rgb values of a single pixel on a
    digital photograph by a factor of 1. So how many different hashes or digital finger prints are there? Well that is
    simple math lol, just 2 to the power of 256.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Calling this an astronomically large number would be an insult to the
    number. For reference, the diameter of the observable universe is 93 billion lightyears, ie one hundred septillion.
    Calling SHA 256 the worldâ€™s most computed algorithm would be an understatement and the algorithm is the basis for
    cryptography, authentication, digital signatures etc. No one and I mean no one has figured out a way to reverse the
    algorithm. The bitcoin protocol currently operates on SHA 256 and the algorithm was developed by the NSA (National
    Security Agency). So, I am sure you remember the cryptocurrency mining craze that was ongoing for the better part of
    2018 and into 2019 that drove the prices of graphics cards flying. Well, what does mining bitcoin really mean? Well
    the
    ledger for bitcoin as most of you will know is known as the block chain and as the name suggests it is a chain of
    blocks
    (set of records) that are joined using cryptography. Mining in a sense is record keeping, ie. keeping the blockchain
    unalterable, consistent and complete. Each block has the SHA 256 hash of the previous block and that links it to the
    previous block; miners will have to use brute force tactics to generate the SHA 256 hash of the previous block or a
    close enough match. By doing so they will have generated bitcoin, hence the name mining. I will cover the block
    chain
    and the details of how the bitcoin protocol operates in a future review. Takes this as an introduction to the
    algorithm
    that underlies blockchain.</p>
