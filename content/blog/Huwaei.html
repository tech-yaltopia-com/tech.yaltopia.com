<div>To buy a smart phones there are certain criteria's that should be met before you decide to buy I have listed all
    below.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>1.<b>Performance</b> when your buying a phone you have to be sure that your phone is equipped with the necessary
    specs to handle what you need it to do.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>&nbsp;2.<b>Battery</b> just being powerful isn't enough it should also be able to do anything you want for as long
    as possible.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>3.<b>Build Quality</b> this very important cause the material enclosing your battery and processing system should
    be &nbsp;durable even,if dropped able it should be able to withstand the damage. Keep it running smoothly and
    maintain its temperature very well.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>4.<b>Money</b> I understand people would have bought a phone with all those but its the amount of money there
    willing to spend. Therefore, buying something worth what your spending is the main objective.</div>

                width="320" class="img-responsive"></a></div><br><br><br><br>So for today will be looking at the Huawei
    P9 made by a Chinese company with the cooperation of leica. The aim of this company is to hit the mid priced smart
    phone market making smart phones accessible to everyone.That is why Huawie has set out to change the market by
    influencing people to also consider their products since there already well established companies such as Samsung,
    Apple and Nokia. They presented the Huawei P9 on April 2016 available with 3GB Ram/32GB storage and also 4GB
    ram/64GB storage.Equipped with a powerful Octa-core (4x2.5Ghz Cortex-A72 &amp; 4x1.8Ghz Cortex -A53) it could handle
    anything you throw at it with flying colors.<br><br>Looking onto the build quality I didn't like it too much. They
    should have used more metal it would have been more durable, but nevertheless it looks great with a semi glass
    finish on the top with metal on the side.Coming to the display it has a 1080x1920 beautiful display playing 1080
    videos at 60fps,and 720 at 120fps(frames per second).<br><br>This isn't to bad but sadly doesn't support 4K (please
    refer to our other articles if your not familiar with this display).The camera 13MP with 1080p recording
    possible,and if your looking for high quality photos I wouldn't recommend you to buy it.A battery with 3000mAh
    Li-lon (sealed) this would do you good for a day if you run simple applications,but if your pushing it to the limit
    expect at least a 5hr long battery.Fast charging is also possible getting 45% in just 30minutes.It also has a finger
    print senser , a microsd slot upgradable to (256 GB) and two sims slots (Supporting both 4G,and 3G
    connection).<br><br>It's quite light because of its finishing touch is plastic. In overall this a good phone for the
    average consumer it's cheap if your not willing to spend that much just by comprising a bit on the build quality it
    will a great investment.This could also be a good start up phone for our fellow Africans this will get them more
    acquainted with smart phones.

<div>So lets scale it up 1=bad, 2=good,3=V.good ,and 4=Excellent.</div>
