<p id="p1" style="text-align: center; font-size: x-large;"> Happy new year to all
    our
    Ethiopian viewers!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>In light of this being a once in a year celebration, we here at ICT group have a
    special
    review written to show you that 2010 E.C is going to be a great year. 2009 was a year of many technological firsts
    with
    lots of new and cool gadgets flooding markets worldwide for every customer out there and as such 2009 was not one to
    disappoint people – be it common user or a critic. However, with all the new technology lying ahead, 2010 is
    boasting
    that it can take down 2009 with ease.<br><br> Best products of 2009 E.C<br><br>1.<span class="Apple-tab-span"
        style="white-space: pre;"></span>Samsung Galaxy S8/S8
    plus<br>Samsung hit a much-needed
    home run after the PR
    disaster caused by its Galaxy Note 7. That's what the Korean tech giant got with the Galaxy S8, a redesigned
    smartphone
    with a dazzling screen, long battery life, and a great camera. The S8's curved display give the feeling of a
    borderless
    screen, making it more adept at displaying games and movies. The S8 isn’t perfect—its voice assistant wasn’t ready
    at
    launch, and some found its fingerprint sensor to be awkwardly placed—but it’s a big win overall.<br><br>2.<span
        class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>LG Signature W-Series "Wallpaper" TV<br>TV-makers today
    face an impossible task: On one hand, consumers expect new screens to make TV shows and movies look fantastic. On
    the
    other, they want these eye-popping displays to blend seamlessly into their living room. LG's Signature W-Series
    "wallpaper" TV accomplishes this masterfully. The $7,999, 65-inch display weighs just 16 pounds and is .15-inches
    thick,
    making it seem like the screen is floating on the wall. (It’s mounted with magnets, no bulky brackets necessary.)
    But
    it's the OLED (Organic LED) technology that's most impressive. Pairing the blackest blacks possible with rich color
    results in a visually stunning high-contrast.<br><br>3.<span class="Apple-tab-span"
        style="white-space: pre;"></span>&nbsp;Here
    one<br>The next time you’re sitting on a plane with a wailing baby, imagine being able to simply turn down the poor
    kid’s volume. Or you’re hanging out in a crowded bar, struggling to hear your friends, and you boost just their
    voices.
    That’s the promise behind Doppler Labs’ Here One earbuds, which let users manipulate sounds in the world around them
    thanks to onboard microphones and sound processors. In practice, the Here Ones are often better are quieting general
    background noise rather than specific sounds. But Doppler’s innovation reveals how the headphone tech of tomorrow
    could
    make us masters of the audio universe around us.<br><br>4.<span class="Apple-tab-span"
        style="white-space: pre;"></span>&nbsp;Raspberry Pi Zero W<br>Little better exemplifies this concept than
    the Raspberry Pi Foundation's series
    of
    cut-rate micro-computers. And with this year's Raspberry Pi Zero W—effectively a zippier Raspberry Pi Zero with
    wireless
    connectivity included—anyone can forge the bones of a 32-bit computer that runs Linux for $10. Whether you're a
    hobbyist
    tinkering with robotic racers and retro game handhelds or building computers for children in Mali, the promise
    of
    affordable ad-hoc computing just got sweeter.<br><br>5.<span class="Apple-tab-span"
        style="white-space: pre;"></span>&nbsp;Snapchat Spectacles<br>Much like Snapchat itself, you either get it
    or you don't. Snapchat parent company
    Snap
    Inc. debuted its Spectacles video-recording glasses late last year. An easy setup process, good-enough video
    quality
    and
    stylish look made Spectacles a hit. From a hardware perspective, Spectacles could use improvement—they’re not
    great
    when
    it’s dark out and they’re troublesome for prescription eyeglass wearers. But Snap’s first foray into hardware
    shows
    promise at a time when camera companies like GoPro are struggling.<br><br>6.<span class="Apple-tab-span"
        style="white-space: pre;"></span>&nbsp;Superpedestrian Copenhagen Wheel<br>Superpedestrian’s robotic bike wheel
    augments
    cyclists’ oomph by powering their ride up to 20 miles per hour for over 30 miles. Though it looks like a simple
    bike
    wheel, the Copenhagen packs impressive technology inside. An integrated motor powered by a battery provides the
    giddy
    up, a wireless sensor connects to smartphones for data crunching, smart-locking hardware makes sure no one makes
    off
    with this $1,499 wheel, and regenerative brakes add to the efficiency. Cycling purists might shun the device,
    but
    it’s
    really geared for the increasing number of bike commuters out there. Turns out reinventing the wheel was worth
    it.

    <br>What to expect from 2010?<br>Well it is still too early to call on which products mentioned will make it
    to
    store
    and what other products might manage to fit in the next 363 days but here are the products that are rumored to
    be
    unveiled in 2010.<br><br><br>1.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The IPhone 8 – this is
    a
    confirmed
    one actually and will be released in a matter of days if not weeks to the public and there is no doubt in
    anyone’s
    minds
    that this will be among the greatest thing to be released this year, at least for now.<br>2.<span
        class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>WiFi will be more available!!! A new study shows
    that
    in 2010 there will be a WiFi
    connection for every 20 people.<br>3.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Pcell –with
    the
    help
    of this new tech phones might boost cellular connectivity by over a thousand times the normal speed.<br>4.<span
        class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>First 3D printed car will be made available, it
    says it
    all!<br>5.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>And last but not least, 10Gbps Wi-Fi
    will
    be
    available at 5GHz frequency bands. For those that don’t speak geek, that is very fast.<br>6.<span
        class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Apple will be implementing OLED screens on their
    new
    line of gadgets
    revolutionizing the smartphone industry.<br>Well this list looks slim but I need to remind our dear readers that
    the
    year is still young and whatever awaits down the line is still now known yet. However, from what we can tell
    2010
    will
    be a year to remember.<br></span>
