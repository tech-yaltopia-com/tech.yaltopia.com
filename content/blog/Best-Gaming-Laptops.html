    Well if you are reading this you are probably an Ethiopian, if not that's OK,
    but if you are then this is for you. PC enthusiasts like me have long since
    tried to get high functioning desktops to game and be productive as well, but
    with problems involved with imports most of us end up with laptops. Laptops
    are not that bad, but they don't come close to the performance offered by
    their desktop counterparts. Desktops although powerful also have their flaws,
    they are clunky and totally immobile. So, you might ask yourself what is the
    solution? What is a portable desktop replacement? Well we have an answer for
    you, not 'THE ANSWER', but an answer all the same: Gaming laptops. Most
    laptops nowadays with discrete GPUs are marketed as gaming laptops, but you
    don't have to game with them it's just an added benefit. With the horse power
    of a gaming laptop you can render and edit videos very efficiently and for
    especially for software engineering students it can be a God send. Then you
    might ask which gaming laptop is the best? This is truly a very difficult
    question, but I think I have the answer. Anytime you are in the market for a
    high performance laptop (gaming laptop) you are sure to have certain criteria,
    I will try to list the most desired:<br /><br><br>
    
    <div style="border-style: groove; padding: 4%;">
        <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Performance (A good graphics card able to push triple AAA titles at decent frame rates, edit videos
                blazing
                fast
                or maybe run game engines (for developers).</li><br>
            <li>Durability (A laptop needs to be made from durable material that can last you a while since it's such a
                huge investment)</li><br>
            <li>A decent Battery life (chances are if you are using buying a laptop you are mostly a mobile person:
                student,
                professor,
                contractor... and you either don't want to carry your charger everywhere you
                go or there might an absence of plugs where you are.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    These are the three things that most laptop buyers look for and most laptop buyers have no idea
    about the engineering behind the laptops. Sorry to break it to you, but it is
    practically impossible to have a near perfect laptop like the one I described
    above, but there are some that come close. Here they are,<br /><br><br>
    <div style="border-style: groove; padding: 4%;">
        <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>ALIENWARE 17-R4</li><br>
            <li>ASUS ROG GL502</li><br>
            <li>Razer Blade pro late 2016 edition</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <br /><br /><br /><br>Stay
    tuned for separate reviews on all three laptops and since we are not sponsored
    by any of these companies you can trust us unlike many websites and pages.
