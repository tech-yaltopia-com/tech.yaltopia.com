        <div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Yes, it’s finally here the iphone 7 equipped with the A10 chip with 4
                        cores:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>two for highly intense tasks, and the other
                        two are
                        used for less demanding things this enables the phone to save more power. <span
                                style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>As usual apple was expected to make the iphone
                        better than its
                        previous predecessors but this time it seems like they polished of the iphone 6S. It might also
                        be due the
                        various leaks that made the phone just what we expected no more. Even with the low energy cores
                        you won’t
                        find such a big power saving capacity its quite average. </span></div>

                        you will
                        notice the bigger
                        storage capacity now it won’t start from 16GB it stars from 32GB so no more deleting pictures or
                        backing to
                        make space for a new app. They have also made good use of the A10 for faster opening times of
                        apps. Also,
                        hasn’t lost the richness of color since they aren’t like other companies which move up to higher
                        resolutions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you compare it with other phones
                        though you
                        can see it clearly that the iphone 7 lacks sharpness to the likes of S7. The design is the same
                        as iphone 6s
                        with the same colors but the addition of the black color which is pleasing to look at. Other
                        things you will
                        notice is no headphone jack will get to that in a moment, also they moved up the antennas up a
                        bitter higher
                        giving the back a new view. Auto brightness has also been improved since there were issues in
                        the
                        calibration of the brightness at brighter environments but now you could play or text or look at
                        your feed
                        without going to your settings to adjust it.
                </span></div>
        <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
        <div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Recently been reading some issues about the back getting scratched so
                        easily I would recommend a cover of your choosing. Coming to the home button is one of the big
                        changes since
                        it won’t give you a physical feedback anymore “weird ikr!”. Looking at the home button now its
                        sensitive to
                        pressure and gives a small vibration to make you feel it’s been pressed. Not the same feeling
                        though to what
                        we were used that won’t be a problem you just need to adjust to it but it will still feel weird.
                        This might
                        be the last time we see the home button so treasure this moment because it seems like it’s only
                        a matter of
                        time before it goes. There have also been issues that you can’t use gloves while using the phone
                        since it
                        might not recognize it so I sympathies with my readers at chiller environments, so what I advise
                        you to do
                        is to go the apple store with your favorite set of gloves hope it works fingers crossed.<span

        <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
        <div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Speaking about removing things we got used no more headphone jack
                        after
                        all the speculation our hearts can rest now. This might hurt companies involved with making
                        headphones
                        (beats, JBL , and skullcandy) but a move like this by a big company such as apple will lead to
                        other big
                        companies following their footsteps only time can tell now. Is it better though it didn’t make
                        the phone any
                        lighter and air pods okay their features are impressive but removing the headphone jack made
                        things
                        complicated speaking from experience I have changed to lots of ear phones due to many issues.
                        Now am sure
                        that ear pods are gone be subjected to my clumsiness and get lost the wired once are relatively
                        cheap so
                        it’s okay but when it comes to your ear pods its twice as much so that’s a big issue. Even if
                        they made this
                        3.5mm adapter that we plug to use headphone jack sad thing is they don’t come with the iphone 7
                        so that’s
                        also extra cost to. I can tell you this the ear pods don’t sound any better than the headphone
                        jack still
                        too early to judge since they might make it better. Even with the removal of the Jack port the
                        speakers at
                        bottom are the same expect they made the second opening just stereo so no two speakers.</span>

        <div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">How about that camera especially the two cameras on iphone 7 plus
                        which we
                        will have a follow up review on. The iphone 7 isight camera 12mp is also good the big changes
                        they made is
                        change the lens with a wider aperture f1.8 this allows more light to the camera for better
                        pictures in low
                        light conditions and the performance has also been improved from iphone 6s. The front camera is
                        the quite
                        good that it seems like you’re taking a selfie with rear camera with just some minor
                        differences. To make
                        the pictures you take better they have made the true tone 50% as apple says it’s to compensate
                        for indoor
                        lightning.</span></div>
        <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
        <div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Water proof seems like a bonus after other companies already did
                        looking
                        at the iphone 7 now seems like not that big of change. In overall, it’s a good phone they have
                        tried to
                        change lots of things that made phone better, and in some cases worse (Home Button). Buying it
                        well looking
                        at the market right you will find something better, so I wouldn’t recommend buying it. Since
                        looking at the
                        price you could get something better with cash to spare for a cover, and may be even extra
                        “headphones”. So
                        as always let’s see the overall score of the phone from five stars.</span></div>
