                        style="font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%; color:white;">Laptops
                        have
                        come a long way from the giant ‘The Osborne 1’ to the laptops of today. The progression of
                        technology is
                        very peculiar, especially the technology that is produced for the mass consumers i.e. ‘you’. You
                        see the
                        logical thing to assume is things that are bigger are better and if you are of that notion, I
                        wouldn’t blame
                        you and that same logic applies to technology somewhat. Bigger packages often tend towards
                        better
                        performance or raw power in technology. For example, let us compare a gaming laptop and desktop,
                        until very
                        recently GPUs and CPUs outfitted in laptops were very underpowered versions of their desktop
                        counterparts;
                        take the Intel Kabylake
                        <div class="popup" onclick="myFunction()" style="display: inline;">7700K
                                <span class="popuptext" id="myPopup" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 25%; padding-right: 25%;">
                                        <strong><u>Core i7-7700K:</u> </strong> is a 64-bit quad-core high-end
                                        performance x86 desktop
                                        microprocessor introduced by Intel
                                        in 2017. This processor, which is based on the Kaby Lake microarchitecture, is
                                        manufactured on Intel's
                                        improved 14nm+ process. The i7-7700K operates at 4.2 GHz with a TDP of 91 W and
                                        with a Turbo Boost
                                        frequency of 4.5 GHz for a single active core.

                        </div>
                        and the mobile equivalent the 7700HK
                        while both are of the Intel
                        corei7 line
                        the 7700K is comparably very powerful; this is because the 7700K is a desktop CPU and has a
                        higher power
                        draw when compared to the 7700HK, by drawing more power it is able to perform better. This
                        doesn’t mean that
                        the graph of wattage supplied and the performance gained is a linear one, but it is definitely
                        increasing
                        for the first section of the graph and then the graph peaks out at a point we call the ‘Peak
                        efficiency’.
                        But I digress, performance is not the only factor in the progression of technology, making
                        technology better
                        while simultaneously making them smaller and more portable is what consumers want and is the
                        primary aim
                        behind any tech mogul these days.&nbsp;</span></div><br><br>

                        gets me
                        back to the topic of my review for today: Detachable laptops. Detachable laptops aka Hybrids aka
                        laplets aka
                        2in1s aka convertibles, jeez they have a lot names for these devices don’t they, I will call
                        them hybrids
                        for the remainder of this review. Hybrids are essentially devices that can be used as both
                        tablets and
                        laptops, hence the unofficial name laplets which is a clever blend of the names ‘Laptop’ and
                        ‘Tablet’. A
                        tablet is a touch sensitive and a touch enabled device as many of you might already know and
                        with the ever
                        growing love for touch enabled devices like most smartphones nowadays Tablets are also very
                        sought after by
                        people. They are slim devices that you can fit into your schoolbag for a quick read of your
                        favorite book in
                        your lunch break, for checking your social media in between appointments or even to consume
                        media like
                        movies and shows while in bed; these are all activities that you can do with your smartphone,
                        but you must
                        admit most of these activities are better done or enjoyed with a larger device. So a tablet is
                        essentially a
                        device that is slightly smaller and lighter than a laptop, but larger than your average smart
                        phone. There
                        are caveats to tablets however they are mostly less powerful than laptops and if you want more
                        punch out of
                        your device a laptop is your safest bet. What if you want the best of both worlds? Well, the
                        closest answer
                        to that question is hybrids. Hybrids are usually fully stocked ultra-books that have a touch
                        enabled screen
                        and that can detach from the body of the laptop to serve as a more portable tablet. The way
                        hybrids are
                        engineered varies with different devices for example there are tablets that have certain parts
                        in the
                        keyboard (detachable area) which may include a discrete GPU or data storage like a hard drive,
                        there also
                        might be devices that have every single part packed in what is the predominantly the screen area
                        and a
                        detachable keyboard is given for work that involves a physical keyboard. So are these devices
                        worth it?
                        Well, that depends on who you ask in my opinion you are better served with having a laptop for
                        your
                        intensive tasks, but I would be remise if I didn’t say that I understand their value. If you are
                        a person
                        who is constantly mobile and you wish to have a small device that is close to being the best of
                        both worlds
                        then go ahead and get a 2in1, but be careful while choosing your device and choose the one that
                        is the best
                        suits your needs. I will be explaining the differences between the various 2in1s out there and
                        which to
                        choose for certain situations in a post very soon so stay tuned.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
